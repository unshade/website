Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform manages external resources (such as public cloud infrastructure, private cloud infrastructure, network appliances, software as a service, and platform as a service) with a "provider" model.

This project is a Terraform provider for Infomaniak, a Swiss web hosting and cloud services company. The provider is built using the Go programming language and the Terraform Plugin SDK (tfsdk). It allows users to manage Infomaniak resources such as Kubernetes clusters, Databases clusters, and other cloud services using Terraform.

This was built as part of my work at Infomaniak as a Software Engineer in the Cloud-Computing team.
